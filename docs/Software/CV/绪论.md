**劳伦斯·罗伯茨**

- In 1963, Lawrence Roberts, a PhD student at the MIT, completed his thesis "Machine concept of three-dimensional solids" , which is considered as **the first professional thesis in the field of computer vision**; this thesis describes the process of deriving three-dimensional information from two-dimensional images in the ideal block world
- In view of his groundbreaking contribution, Roberts is widely considered as **the father of computer vision**

- CVPR (IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Patter
Recognition)was founded in 1983
- ICCV (IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision) was founded in 1987

**Yann LeCun**

- He s a [Turing Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award "Turing Award") winning French [computer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist "Computer scientist") working primarily in the fields of [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning"), [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision"), [mobile robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_robotics "Mobile robotics") and [computational neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience "Computational neuroscience").
- He is well known for his work on [optical character recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition "Optical character recognition") and [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision") using [convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network "Convolutional neural network") (CNN), and is a founding father of convolutional nets.
